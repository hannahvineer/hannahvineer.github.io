# Impact

We're very proud to be able to deliver our research outputs directly to stakeholders, thanks to a great team and strong partnerships. This page will be updated as new tools become available. 

**SCOPS *Nematodirus* alerts**
![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/nematodirus.jpeg){: style="width: 350px; float: right; margin: 0px  10px"}
Dynamic hazard maps for potentially deadly *Nematodirus battus* transmission to young lambs. Updated daily during the season of risk using real-time weather data. 
Access the alerts [here](https://www.scops.org.uk/forecasts/nematodirus-forecast/)

**The Hub**

The One Health Vector-Borne Diseases Hub is a research hub for data sharing, exploration, and collaboration on vector-borne diseases both in the UK and globally.
Access The Hub at [vbdhub.org](https://vbdhub.org)

**Brainworm app**

*Under active development*
We deliver weather-based predictions of transmission risk to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute on request, to assist reindeer herders with their decision making. This new tool will allow the veterinarians and herders to access predictions on demand. 

**Interactive African tick mapping**

*Under active development*
We have coupled machine learning models of tick environmental suitability with indicators of human and livestock vulnerability to exposure. An interactive platform for the maps and corresponding uncertainty indicators are being developed to allow veterinarians and policy-makers to assess and develop strategies to mitigrate risks in their region.
